**TODO**: 
* randomly generated terrain
* enemy ai
* NPCs with different AI (case based?)
* weapon stats, different grades of weapons, etc
* weapon modifiers
* items
* shops
* dialog trees
* animations, spesifically: walking, opening things, (switch to water animation? test.)
* dynamic climate
* levels
* audio

abstract inventory lists?


bug list:
* self.cur_opt is being updated, but the position of the cursor isn't
* the context key doesnt trigger the sub menu, might have to do with self.opt_highlighted
