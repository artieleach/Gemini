**TODO**: 
* give each item a designation for where it goes when equipped, eg weapons::hands, rings::fingers, etc
* rework the "equipped" screen to be more of a chart of where equipped items are, rather than a list.
* randomly generated terrain?
* instead of manually making an 800% version of the tilesets, have the image library do that.
